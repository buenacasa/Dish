He raved about the food—said the Cuban sandwich was spot-on delicious and the beans were perfectly seasoned. Loved the vibe too, reminded him of spots in interior Mexico. But the service? Yikes. The waitress dropped the check mid-bite, saying her shift was over, and they were out of desserts and to-go coffees despite him asking earlier. Jack chimed in, suggesting it’s fixable and he’d mention it to the owner, Ray, to make it right. Still, Alejandro’s willing to give it another shot."
25021402,THELAKEH,02/14/2025,Zing,"""Only good thing tasteful was the coleslaw.""","Michael had a rough time at The Lakehouse in Kerrville. He went with his wife and daughter, expecting some solid Hill Country eats. His catfish was meh, his daughter’s cheeseburger tasted like a sad school lunch, and his wife’s chicken fried steak had a human hair in it—gross! They comped and remade her meal, which was decent of them, but it was just a basic Sam’s patty with gravy. Only the coleslaw got a thumbs-up. Michael was bummed, especially since it’s been around a while with decent reviews. First-time call for this spot, and Jack noted it didn’t sound too good."

It’s tight on seating, so he suggests calling ahead. Jack loved the call, and it’s the first time Wahoo’s has been on The Dish. Wayne’s enthusiasm makes you want to drive out there ASAP!"
25021404,SALTGRAS,02/14/2025,Praise,"""Ribeye with the baked potato… so delicious.""","Mary and her Valentine pals hit up Saltgrass on the River Walk. Her ribeye had to go back once, but when it came out right, it was delicious—same for her friends’ orders, with baked potatoes and salads shining too. The wine and a cranberry-vodka-lime drink were highlights. Downside? Super crowded and loud in the middle, so she’d opt for a booth next time. Jack noted how noisy hard floors and high ceilings can get—maybe they need some carpeting! Still, she’d go back."
25021405,REDBUDCA,02/14/2025,Praise,"""Excellent quiche… soups and sandwiches.""","Jeff stopped by Redbud Cafe in Blanco after work and can’t stop praising it. He’s been multiple times and loves the quiche combo—quiche with soup or a half sandwich. Great beer selection too. But the kicker? At 6 PM, a one-man band led the packed place in singing the National Anthem—everyone stood up, and it gave him goosebumps. They do it every Friday and Saturday with live music. Jack compared it to a Casablanca moment and said it makes him want to go. First call for Redbud, and Jeff sold it hard!"

She’s not a Cuban food expert, but this place won her over with its $20 all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch—fruit, pastries, charcuterie, bacon, eggs, French toast, Cuban rice, the works! She brought her dog to the patio (bonus: there’s a playground for kids), and the family vibe—run by her friend, her husband, and their son—made it feel like home. Karaoke, live jazz, and flamenco nights add flair. Jack loved her take, noting he’s been there too and wants it to thrive."
25020702,ELMIRASO,02/07/2025,Praise,"""Green chile relleno… really good!""","Brian gave a shoutout to El Mirasol just shy of Boerne on I-10 West, in the Napa Oaks shopping center. He dug into the green chile relleno and loved it—said the individual nachos were a hit too. Enchiladas get a nod as well. It’s not huge, but he’s never had to wait for a seat, and the outdoor seating’s a nice touch. Jack knew the San Antonio locations — sounds like a solid stop on the way to Boerne!"
25020703,JACKSCHO,02/07/2025,Praise,"""Parmesan Salmon is great!""","Michael has been three times and calls it a gem—great atmosphere, kind staff, and awesome food. The Parmesan Salmon during their 4-6 PM specials is a standout. He’s met locals and travelers alike there, from newlyweds to tourists, and loves the cozy vibe—sitting at the bar’s a perk.
